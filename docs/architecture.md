# dosiz Status, Architecture, and DOS Services

## Status

**Status:** real DOS programs run.  DOS-hosted toolchain binaries run.
Cross-compiler-produced binaries run.  DPMI 0.9 host complete (every
INT 31h sub-function implemented or stubbed, 25 DPMI fixtures green) — real
32-bit DJGPP programs run end-to-end (printf, argv, env, malloc, file I/O,
spawn, POSIX signals, C++ ctors/dtors).  LIM EMS 4.0 plus a VCPI detection
subset are provided on INT 67h.  LE (Linear Executable) loader loads, applies
fixups, installs LDT descriptors, and enters 32-bit protected mode end-to-end
on hand-crafted fixtures; real DOS4G-hosted Watcom binaries load their full
image + apply all fixups but stall on the runtime's DOS4G pre-entry
environment convention (a DPMI-host-compatibility gap).

Example runs, including the Watcom DOS4G stall, are in the [README](../README.md).

## Architecture

	dosiz binary
		emu88 386 CPU + memory + PC hardware (owned by qxDOS, ../qxDOS/emu88)
		DOSBox→emu88 compatibility shim (src/compat/)
		host-side DOS: INT 21h/31h/67h handlers → C++ file / memory / process calls
		.cfg parser (cpmemu-style)

No subprocess, no config files beyond the optional `.cfg`. The guest sees a
DOS; the host implements what that DOS does.

## DOS services

The emu88 386 core provides the CPU + memory + PC hardware, driven through a
thin DOSBox→emu88 compatibility shim (`src/compat/`). DOS INT 21h is handled
entirely by C++ host code. Currently implemented:

	01  stdin char+echo    0E  set drive          3E  close handle
	02  putchar            0B  stdin ready?       3F  read handle
	07  stdin char no-echo 19  get drive          40  write handle
	08  stdin char no-echo 1A  set DTA            41  unlink
	09  print string       25  set int vector     42  seek handle
	0A  buffered input     29  parse filename     43  get/set attr
	2A  get date           2C  get time           44  ioctl (basic)
	30  get DOS version    33  ctrl-break         47  get cwd
	35  get int vector     37  switchar           48  alloc (MCB)
	38  country info       39  mkdir              49  free + coalesce
	3A  rmdir              3B  chdir              4A  resize (MCB)
	3C  create handle      3D  open handle        4B  exec
	4C  exit               4E  findfirst          4F  findnext
	50  set PSP            51  get PSP            56  rename
	5D  network (stub)     62  get PSP            63  lead-byte (stub)
	6C  extended open

INT 2Fh AX=1687h reports DPMI 0.90 (32-bit capable).  INT 31h
implements the full DPMI 0.9 spec: LDT descriptor mgmt (AX=0000..000C),
DOS memory alloc (0100..0102), IVT get/set (0200..0201), PM exception
handlers (0202..0203, live dispatch via IDT gate), PM IDT gates
(0204..0205), simulate-RM-INT and call-RM-procedure (0300..0302),
RM callbacks (0303..0304, 16-bit + 32-bit PM), state save/restore
stubs (0305..0306), version (0400), memory info (0500), linear memory
alloc/free/resize (0501..0503) with a two-tier MCB-under-1MB /
pm_arena-above-1MB backing store, lock/unlock and paging stubs
(0600..0604, 0702..0703), physical mapping pass-through (0800..0801),
virtual IF state (0900..0902), and debug watchpoint stubs (0B00..0B03).

INT 67h provides a functional LIM EMS 4.0 manager (a host-side page pool
reached through a 16KB×4 page frame at 0xE000, allocate/map/realloc/move/
save-restore) plus a VCPI detection + page-count subset (DE00/DE02/DE03/DE0A);
the VCPI PM-transition functions return "unsupported" so extenders fall back
to dosiz's DPMI.

RM<->PM mode switching is full-fidelity: 16-bit and 32-bit client
entry both work, INT 21h from PM reflects to our host handler via
PM IDT gate, INT 21h AH=09h string output works from PM, and
per-vector reflection shims (`66 CF` IRETD) handle 32-bit-gate
frames for INT 10h/etc. dispatched back to real-mode BIOS.

LE binaries (the format Watcom's DOS4G and DOS4GW produce) are
loaded, fixed up (source types 0x05/0x07/0x08 fully, 0x02/0x03/0x06
with per-object LDT selectors), given one LDT descriptor per object
(base/limit/access/D-bit from object flags), and launched directly
into 32-bit PM at the LE header's entry_obj:entry_eip.  `LE_MIN.EXE`
runs end-to-end through PM INT 21h AH=4Ch to rc=0.  Real Watcom
binaries load + execute ~0.2s of PM code before hitting the DOS4G
pre-entry environment convention.

PSP:[2Ch] points at an env block populated with `COMSPEC`, `PATH`, and
whichever of `HOME`/`USER`/`TMPDIR`/`LANG` are set on the host, followed
by an `argc`/`argv[0]` record per DOS convention.


## Command tail, drive mounts, and text mode

PSP command tail at offset 80h is populated from argv. Drive mounts and
per-file / per-pattern mappings come from a `.cfg` file:

	program        = PROG.EXE
	args           = /q /v
	drive_C        = /home/me/dos
	drive_D        = /mnt/sources
	default_mode   = text           # all files: CRLF<->LF
	HELLO.TXT      = /real/path/hello_long_name.txt text
	*.BAS          = text           # mode-only wildcard override

Text mode strips CR on write, so files land on the host in Unix format.
It does NOT expand LF to CRLF on read: disk reads are binary whatever the
mode says, because inflating the byte count breaks anything that seeks
relative to EOF. Only stdin is cooked. No subprocess, no DOS shell, no config
files beyond the optional `.cfg`.
